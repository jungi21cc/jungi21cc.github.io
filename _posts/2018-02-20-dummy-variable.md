Understanding dummy variable by ANCOVA models

Yi = α1 + α2D2i + α3D3i + α4Xi + Ui


where,

Yi = average annual salary of public school teachers in state i
Xi = State expenditure on public schools per pupil
D2i = 1, if the State i is in the North Region
D2i = 0, otherwise
D3i = 1, if the State i is in the South Region
D3i = 0, otherwise


Say the regression output for this model is

Ŷi = 13,269.11 − 1673.514D2i − 1144.157D3i + 3.2889Xi
